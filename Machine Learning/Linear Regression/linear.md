# Linear Regression

## What is it?
What is it: stat technique used to find the relationship between variables. In ML context, linear regression finds the relationship between features and a label.

## Equation

The model can be expressed as `y = mx + b`. 

In ML, we can express this model as `y' = b + w1x1`
  - y` is the predicted label -- the output
  - b is the bias -- Bias is the same concept as the y intercept. It is a parameter of the model that is calculated during training.
  - w1 is the weigth of the feature. Weight is the same concept as the slope. It is a paramter of the model and is calculated during trainging as well.
  - x1 is the input feature.
